1) file structure

router = map between URL → component.

old way of routing pages router. each file in /pages becomes a route
new way of routing is app/. this uses react server componenets, laoyouts and nested routes. 

/app    
    - page.tsx          // /
    /about
        -page.tsx       // /about
    /blog/[id]
        -page.tsx       // /blog./:id


/auth                   // this is also convention
